We can use `wpscan` to do some initial enumeration on the WordPress app and collect some information like what users are associated with the site:

```bash
jeffrowell@kali:~/Documents/TryHackMe/Blog$ wpscan --url http://blog.thm -e u

So we have gathered that there are the following users:
*  kwheel
*  bjoel

Now that we have these usernames we can put them in a file to use as a username list and run `wpscan` once more to crack the passwords. Running `wpscan` to crack the passwords, we are able to find the password of the `kwheel` user:

```bash

We know that WordPress 5.0 is being used from the enumeration done with `wpscan`, so we can look to see if there are any exploits for this version that we can leverage now that we have user access. Running `searchsploit` we see that there is an exploit we can use:

```bash
jeffrowell@kali:~/Documents/TryHackMe/Blog$ searchsploit wordpress 5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                                                                                                                                             |  Path
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
WordPress Core 5.0 - Remote Code Execution                                                                                                                                                                 | php/webapps/46511.js
WordPress Core 5.0.0 - Crop-image Shell Upload (Metasploit)                                                                                                                                                | php/remote/46662.rb
```

We can use the crop-image shell upload exploit to get a shell using `msfconsole`:

### user.txt


### Where was user.txt found?
```
/media/usb
```

### What CMS was Billy using?
```
wordpress
```

### What version of the above CMS was being used?
```
5.0
```
